Hi there 👋 I go by Tesla Ice Zhang. Typical usernames include `ice1000` or `tizusa`.

+ 🌱 I have a [blog], [opensource-contributions], a [resume], a research [profile], and a [codewars] profile.
+ 🤔 I'm learning [HoTT] and is researching on its constructive interpretations, like cubical type theories.
  I'm also interested in [2LTT] -- using [XTT] as the non-fibrant type theory might be a good idea?
+ 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on a dependently-typed programming language [Aya] with some interesting ideas.
  It's going to be a practical proof assistant with programming features.
+ 💬 Ask me about IDEs, type theories and implementation of (univalent) dependent type systems!
