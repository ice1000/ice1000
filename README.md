Hi there 👋 I go by Tesla Zhang. Typical social media usernames include `ice1000` or `tizusa`.

+ 🌱 I have a [personal website][blog], where my [resume] is also hosted.
+ 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on:
  + Session type research with my advisor Stephanie Balzer.
  + The [Aya] language with some interesting ideas. Goal: make it practical, like Idris2,
    but with effective quotients and constructive proof of funExt!
    + The [website][AyaWeb] contains installation instructions and basic tutorials. Stay tuned for more!
  + Automated theorem proving with Chase Norman. [Project Demo](https://chasenorman.com).
+ 💬 Ask me about IDEs, type theories, implementation of (univalent) dependent type systems, and 3A yoyoing (string tricks using two yoyos)!

## Where to find my writings

- (graduate, English) Some academic articles are uploaded to [arXiv][arXiv profile] and my research [blog].
- (late college & graduate, English) Proof assistants related Q&A on [Stack Exchange][PASE].
- (graduate, 中文) [Chenjing Bu](https://github.com/abccsss) is building *Banana Space* ([香蕉空间](https://www.bananaspace.org)),
  a modern math wiki in Chinese. I mainly contribute to type theory stuffs and related areas inspired from another contributor Trebor.

  如果您想要学习类型论，且对阅读英语感到困难，我非常推荐您浏览香蕉空间的相关板块，这些内容主要面向有一定数学背景的读者。如果您对其中的内容有疑问，请联系我。
- (late college, 中文) Basic type theory tutorials & guides on [茶饭](https://cha.fan/articles/7hPpxieZrGXd8diUzyxM).
- (mid & late college, English) Thoughts / tutorials about Agda, cubical, and PL design on the [Aya website][AyaWeb].
- (pre & early college, 中文) Loads of low-quality contents, those can be found on 知乎 and my old blog (deleted).
  I strongly discourage anyone to read them -- unless you explicitly intend to humiliate me.
