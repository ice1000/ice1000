Hi there üëã I go by Tesla Zhang. Typical usernames include `ice1000` or `tizusa`.

+ üå± I have a [blog], [opensource-contributions], a [resume], a [research profile], an [arXiv profile], and a [codewars profile].
+ ü§î I'm learning [HoTT] and is researching on its constructive interpretations, like cubical type theories.
  + I tried to implement CHM in [Guest0x0], and the work is now integrated into [Aya] (see below).
  + I'm also interested in [2LTT] and Andras Kovacs' ideas on staged programming with 2LTT.
  + I will probably implement [CCobs] as the pretype theory in [Aya].
  + Cool people are working on [implementing][XTT-impl] XTT, check it out!
+ üë®‚Äçüíª I'm currently working on a dependently-typed programming language [Aya] with some interesting ideas.
  It's going to be a practical proof assistant with programming features.
  + The [website][AyaWeb] contains installation instructions and basic tutorials. Stay tuned for more!
+ üí¨ Ask me about IDEs, type theories and implementation of (univalent) dependent type systems!
